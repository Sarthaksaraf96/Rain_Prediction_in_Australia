This Project presents a set of experiments that involve the use of common machine learning techniques to create models that can predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not based on the weather data for that day in Australia

ML Algorithms Used:

1)K-Nearest Neighbour

2)Decision Tree Classifier

3)Logistic Regression

4)Support Vector Machine 

5)Multiple Linear Regression

Accuracy Scores:
